## ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡ MAGO ELECTRÃ“NICO 2.0

### Context:

I used to play this 80s game that my grandma gave me when I was a kid. My brother and I learnt to read with the questions on the board. We would point the robot at a question, read it out loud, wonder for a while and then transfer it to the second stand. 
It would suddenly spin and point at the right answer without hesitation ([see it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE0VkjnnxO4)) Magic! It may look naÃ¯ve today, but it was brilliant at the time. It had an effect on people like talking to chatGPT for the first time.

### Aha moment:
Anyways, we outgrew it long ago. Still loved he game for its ingenuity and wanted to honor it with a retrofit. I saw this post by OpenAI and it gave me an idea...

### Build:
So here's what I did:
I replaced the box for a smaller, deeper one, enough to house a servo coupled with a bunch of magnets

Wired a rpi4 with a cheap e-paper module (drew some fan art while at it) and a microphone:

### LLM
Used [openAI api](https://openai.com/api/) (and my credit card) for:
- whisper: speech-to-text the audio prompt
- chat completion (ChatGPT 3.5 at the time)
- Wrapped the prompt to coerce the model into a binary classification to Yes/No

My 2.0 robot wizard will now answer yes/no to any question (not just the hundred in the original game). It will also point gracefully at a 'YES' or 'NO' badge on the board with its cane and provide some context infrmation on the paper screen.

Look at it go :)
